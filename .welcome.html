<p>
<b>Description:</b><br>
A unix based mail filter written in perl to replace procmail and many
other mail utilities.  Source code is free and released under GNU
GPL.<br>
Version 2.4 brings HLDFilter into a swiss army knife type of utility.
Because it is written entirely in perl, and has many features,
hldfilter is not the fastest mailfilter, but for 95% of users, this is
not an issue anyways.  Please read the Features section for more info.
