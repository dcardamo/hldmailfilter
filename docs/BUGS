** CheckUser seems to cause latency with sendmail and sometimes won't work.  If you turn it off in the hldfilter.rc file then you won't get this problem. **

I've tested on my own and it seems to work very well.  If you find a bug,
please email me at wombat@hld.ca with it, as well as your system configuration.

Please include at a minimum:
- mailserver (sendmail, qmail, other...)
- webserver (apache...)
- distribution (redhat, debian, version of it)
- perl version
- the error it put in the log file, or in your mail if you get an error message.

Support for this program is free, and I will do my best, but it is without warranty or liability as stated in the license.

Thanks,

Dan
