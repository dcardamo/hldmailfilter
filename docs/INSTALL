UPGRADING FROM PRE 2.0
----------------------
Version 2.0 Adds a new configuration file as well as new keys in hldfilter.rc.
I suggest either going from scratch as a new install (keep your old logs and
stats though).  Or, merge the new into the old if you feel comfortable with
that.

UPGRADING FROM 2.0 and later
----------------------------
Use your same config files, just point to the hldfilter executable in your
.forward file.

INSTALLATION
------------
There are 3 major things to do here to get hldfilter up and running.  
They are all easy if you already have perl installed.
1) Edit the top line of hldfilter & statsgen.pl to point to your perl binary
2) Run install.pl
3) run hldfilter --init
4) Configure hldfilter

Details
-------
1) Edit the top line of hldfilter and statsgen.pl to point to your perl
   executable.  You can find this by typing 'which perl' at the command line.

   eg:  #!/usr/bin/perl      may become:    #!/usr/local/bin/perl

2) Run install.pl:
       perl install.pl

   Then follow its instructions.  It will copy hldfilter and statsgen.pl into
   /usr/local/bin

3) As a user you would like to have mail filtered for, run the command:
        hldfilter --init

   This will create a config directory, and edit your .forward file to use
   hldfilter.  This will not do any filtering until you configure it by either
   editing the files yourself, or running hldfilter rule commands.  you can see
   these commands by typing "hldfilter --help".

4) Edit your config files for hldfilter which are located in ~/.hldfilter
   The file hldfilter.rc is the control file which sets certain variables and 
   levels.  Edit this one first.

       maildir=<your mail directory where you keep all your mail folders>
       loglevel=0 (if you don't want any logging).
       loglevel=1 (if you do want logging).
       rejectmsg=What you want to say back to spammers
       smtpserver=(your mail server that you send mail through)
       email=youremail@address.com
       statsdir=(the location you copied your stats directory to in step 2)
       statslevel=(0 if you don't want stats, 1 if you do)

   The files "~/.hldfilter/ignore" and "~/.hldfilter/reject" both have the same 
   syntax.  Each line is describes one entry you don't want mail from.  Each 
	 line is matched with the To, From, and CC fields.  If it does match it then 
	 it will either be rejected or ignored.

   The "~/.hldfilter/rules" file is a bit different.  Each line has 2 fields 
   which are separated by ~:~.  The first field is a regex which will be 
	 matched to the To, From, and CC fields.  If it does match then it will be 
	 added to the mailfolder described by the 2nd field.  This folder is in the 
	 maildir directory defined in the hlfilter.rc file.

   Edit the "~/.hldfilter/subjectrules" file.  This file has the same syntax 
	 as the "~/.hldfilter/rules" file, except that the first field is a regex 
	 matched to the Subject field of an email instead.

	 Edit "~/.hldfilter/forwardrules" file.  This is similar to subjectrules
	 except that instead of a folder as the second field, it is the person you
	 want to bounce the email to.  The first field is matched against the subject.

   Edit the "~/.hldfilter/mailback" file.  This file allows you to have your 
	 mail filter autmatically respond to a command.  You can also use this to 
	 have it run commands as you on your system.
   I highly recommend not treating this as a secure method to do that though 
	 since anyone could send you an email to run a command on your machine.  
	 The mailback feature is secure in the sense that you decide which commands 
	 get run, and only they can get run.   Now that that is out of the way, 
	 here's what the syntax is.  Each line is an entry with 4 fields separated 
	 by ~:~.  The first field is the subject regex that you will respond to 
	 automatically.  The 2nd is the type (file or command).  The 3rd is either
   the command or file.  The 4th is your comments you want sent along with it.


4) Edit your crontab to contain the statsgen.pl file.  Try running it first 
   to see if it works.  If it doesn't you may have some permission problems, 
	 or your hldfilter.rc file may have the wrong directory.

   Type "crontab -e" as yourself.  Put a line looking like the following in:
   30  3  *  *  *   /usr/local/bin/statsgen.pl  #hldfilter stats generator

   That will run the command at 3:30AM every day.  Therefore your page will be 
	 updated at that time.  If you want this updated more frequently then tweak 
	 the settings in your crontab.

Thats it.  Hope you like it.  I'm just posting this since I made it for myself and figured others might like it.
