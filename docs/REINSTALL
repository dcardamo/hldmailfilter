hldfilter is backwards compatible with all previous versions of itself.

If you want to run the newer version of hldfilter, make sure that the path
pointing to it in your ~/.forward file is correct.


Make sure you have the following files:
forwardrules  
hldfilter.rc  
ignore  
log  
mailback  
reject  
rejectspam      ( new to 2.4 )
rules  
stats.ignore  
subjectrules

If you don't have any of these files, then just touch it.
